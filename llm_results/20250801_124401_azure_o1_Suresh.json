    "overall_health_summary": "Suresh, at 50, you’ve done a fantastic job staying active and pursuing CrossFit four times a week despite a demanding life schedule and having one functioning kidney. Your biopsy of labs shows many stable areas, like healthy inflammation control and strong nutrient status, which suggests that your consistent effort with supplements and training is paying off. Some of your markers — especially your cholesterol levels, liver enzymes, and kidney filtration — need more focused attention to ensure you sustain a healthy heart and protect your renal function long-term. With a few targeted shifts in your diet, training recovery, and supplement strategy, you can support better metabolic balance and stronger cardiovascular resilience. It’s clear that your dedication and willingness to adapt will help you break through those energy dips and optimize both your performance and longevity goals.",
