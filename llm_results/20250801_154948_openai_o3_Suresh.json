    "overall_health_summary": "Suresh, at 50 you’re juggling intense CrossFit sessions, a demanding schedule, and the desire to keep performing for decades to come—and your decision to review these labs shows true commitment. The data reveal a strong foundation of low inflammation, solid nutrient status, and competitive IGF-1, but also spotlight kidney stress, lipid-related heart risk, and adrenal recovery gaps that can slow your strength gains. The great news is that each red or amber marker is modifiable through targeted tweaks in nutrition, training load, and evidence-backed supplementation that fit an Indian lifestyle. By dialing in recovery and metabolic flexibility now, you’ll lift harder, feel fresher between sessions, and protect that single kidney for the long haul. Let’s channel your discipline into three clear priorities and an actionable six-month roadmap that makes every workout and meal work harder for you.",
