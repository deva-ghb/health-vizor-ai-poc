    "overall_health_summary": "Suresh, at 50 you’re balancing competitive CrossFit sessions, a demanding lifestyle, and a clear desire for long-term strength and longevity. Your labs show many bright spots—low inflammation, good vitamin-D status, and solid anabolic support—while also flagging areas that deserve prompt attention, especially kidney function, cardiovascular lipids, and glucose regulation. The good news is that each of these risk areas responds well to targeted lifestyle tweaks and smart supplementation. By acting now, you can protect your single functioning kidney, sharpen metabolic flexibility, and keep crushing workouts without sacrificing healthspan. Let’s build on your wins and turn the amber and red markers into new personal bests.",

Cardiovascular Risk Pattern: LDL 153 mg/dL + ApoB 91 mg/dL + Homocysteine 20 µmol/L + Total-C 250 mg/dL + smoking history create an atherogenic cluster that can accelerate plaque formation despite good HDL. Addressing lipids and quitting smoking are urgent for your longevity goals.\n3. Early Insulin-Resistance Pattern: Fasting glucose 105 mg/dL + HbA1c 6.0 % alongside low fasting insulin 2.6 µIU/mL and mild ALT elevation point to impaired glucose clearance and hepatic insulin resistance, linking to your post-meal energy crashes.\n4. HPA-Axis Recovery Strain: Low DHEA-S 102 µg/dL + low free testosterone 17.8 pg/mL + borderline high liver enzymes and subjective poor sleep indicate adrenal/testicular recovery demands amplified by high training volume and stress.\n5. Low-Grade Inflammation Controlled: Despite the above stresses, hs-CRP 0.41 mg/L and leukocyte profile are optimal, showing your anti-inflammatory nutrition and supplementation are effective.
