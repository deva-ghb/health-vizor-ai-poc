Your labs reveal strong points‚Äîlike robust HDL, good vitamin D, and healthy inflammatory markers‚Äîthat bolster your fitness goals. However, you do have some areas needing attention, notably kidney function (eGFR at 51.5), elevated cholesterol, and higher homocysteine, plus signs of adrenal and hormone strain. These findings matter because they can impact your long-term vitality, strength gains, and daily energy stability. The good news is that the majority of your markers look supportive, and with a few targeted changes‚Äîin nutrition, supplements, and lifestyle‚Äîyou can sharpen performance and protect your future health. You‚Äôre on a great path, and with some focused steps, you can elevate both your workouts and overall resilience.",
